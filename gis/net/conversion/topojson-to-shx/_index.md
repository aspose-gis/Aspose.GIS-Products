 Conversion can be done with just one line of code while using
 *VectorLayer.Convert* 
 method. It takes 4 parameters as detailed below.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  A string type file path to the source TOPOJSON file
1.  Source driver to let the API know about the input format. Set it to Drivers.TopoJson
1.  The string type file path to the destination SHX data file
1.  Destination driver to specify output format. Set it to Drivers.Shapefile
