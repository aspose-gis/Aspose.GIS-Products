{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

 Conversion can be done with just one line of code while using
 *VectorLayer.Convert* 
 method. It takes 4 parameters as detailed below.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  A string type file path to the source GML file
1.  Source driver to let the API know about the input format. Set it to Drivers.Gml
1.  The string type file path to the destination KML data file
1.  Destination driver to specify output format. Set it to Drivers.Kml

 Aspose.GIS for .NET is a GIS data manipulation and conversion API. It fully supports reading, writing and converting famous GIS data formats such as ESRI Shapefiles, GeoJSON, TopoJSON, ESRI Geodatabase, Geography Markup Language, Google Earth, GPS Exchange Format, MapInfo Formats and OpenStreetMap. It is a standalone .NET based API and does not require any GIS based softwares like ArcGIS / ArcMap, QGIS etc.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="GML" readMoreLink="" >}}

Geographic Markup Language (known as GML) is an XML-based format used in GIS. GML is an open interchange format for geographic transactions on the Internet. This format is data and structure oriented.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="KML" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/gis/kml/" >}}

KML (Keyhole Markup Language) contains geospatial information in XML notation. KML can be opened in Geographic Information System (GIS) applications provided they support it. Many applications have started providing support for KML format after it has been adopted as international standard.
