{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

 Conversion can be done with just one line of code while using
 *VectorLayer.Convert* 
 method. It takes 4 parameters as detailed below.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  A string type file path to the source GPX file
1.  Source driver to let the API know about the input format. Set it to Drivers.Gpx
1.  The string type file path to the destination GeoJSON data file
1.  Destination driver to specify output format. Set it to Drivers.GeoJson

GPX extension represents GPS Exchange format for interchange of GPS data between applications and web services on the internet. It is a light-weight XML format that contains GPS data i.e. waypoints, routes and tracks to be imported and red by multiple programs. GPX is open and is supported by variety of applications and GPS devices.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="GeoJSON" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/gis/geojson/" >}}

GeoJSON is a JSON based format designed to represent the geographical features with their non-spatial attributes. This format defines different JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) objects and their joining fashion. JSON represents a collective information about the Geographical features, their spatial extents, and properties.
