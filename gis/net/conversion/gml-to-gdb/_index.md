 Conversion can be done with just one line of code while using
 *VectorLayer.Convert* 
 method. It takes 4 parameters as detailed below.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  A string type file path to the source GML file
1.  Source driver to let the API know about the input format. Set it to Drivers.Gml
1.  The string type file path to the destination GDB data file
1.  Destination driver to specify output format. Set it to Drivers.FileGdb

GML stands for Geography Markup Language that is based on XML specifications developed by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC). The format is used to store geographic data features for interchange among different file formats. It serves as a modeling language for geographic systems as well as an open interchange format for geographic transactions on the internet.
