 In order to convert GPX to KML, we’ll use
 [Aspose.GIS for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/gis/net) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use GIS API for C# platform. Open
 [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.gis) 
 package manager, search for
 **Aspose.GIS** 
 and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

 Conversion can be done with just one line of code while using
 *VectorLayer.Convert* 
 method. It takes 4 parameters as detailed below.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  A string type file path to the source GPX file
1.  Source driver to let the API know about the input format. Set it to Drivers.Gpx
1.  The string type file path to the destination KML data file
1.  Destination driver to specify output format. Set it to Drivers.Kml

 Aspose.GIS for .NET is a GIS data manipulation and conversion API. It fully supports reading, writing and converting famous GIS data formats such as ESRI Shapefiles, GeoJSON, TopoJSON, ESRI Geodatabase, Geography Markup Language, Google Earth, GPS Exchange Format, MapInfo Formats and OpenStreetMap. It is a standalone .NET based API and does not require any GIS based softwares like ArcGIS / ArcMap, QGIS etc. ‎

Files with GPX extension represent GPS Exchange format for interchange of GPS data between applications and web services on the internet. It is a light-weight XML file format that contains GPS data i.e. waypoints, routes and tracks to be imported and red by multiple programs. GPX file format is open and is supported by variety of applications and GPS devices. GPS data from such files can be loaded for display on mapping applications for geo-spatial purposes.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="KML" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/gis/kml/" >}}

KML, (Keyhole Markup Language contains) geospatial information in XML notation. Files saved as KML can be opened in Geographic Information System (GIS) applications provided they support it. Many applications have started providing support for KML file format after it has been adopted as international standard. KML uses a tag-based structure with nested elements and attributes. All the tags are case-sensitive and the order of these tags, as per KML Reference, is important to follow.
