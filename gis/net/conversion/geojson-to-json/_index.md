 In order to convert GEOJSON to JSON, we’ll use
 [Aspose.GIS for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/gis/net) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use GIS API for C# platform. Open
 [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.gis) 
 package manager, search for
 **Aspose.GIS** 
 and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

 Conversion can be done with just one line of code while using
 *VectorLayer.Convert* 
 method. It takes 4 parameters as detailed below.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  A string type file path to the source GEOJSON file
1.  Source driver to let the API know about the input format. Set it to Drivers.GeoJson
1.  The string type file path to the destination JSON data file
1.  Destination driver to specify output format. Set it to Drivers.TopoJson

 Aspose.GIS for .NET is a GIS data manipulation and conversion API. It fully supports reading, writing and converting famous GIS data formats such as ESRI Shapefiles, GeoJSON, TopoJSON, ESRI Geodatabase, Geography Markup Language, Google Earth, GPS Exchange Format, MapInfo Formats and OpenStreetMap. It is a standalone .NET based API and does not require any GIS based softwares like ArcGIS / ArcMap, QGIS etc. ‎

GeoJSON is a JSON based format designed to represent the geographical features with their non-spatial attributes. This format defines different JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) objects and their joining fashion. JSON format represents a collective information about the Geographical features, their spatial extents, and properties. An object of this file may indicate a geometry (Point, LineString, Polygon), a feature or collection of features. The features reflect addresses and places as point’s streets, main roads and borders as line strings and countries, provinces, and land regions as polygons. Using the GeoJSON, different mobile routing and navigation applications can indicate the coverage of their services. An extension of GeoJSON is TopoJSON that is smaller in size and encodes geospatial topology.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="JSON" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/web/json/" >}}

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is an open standard file format for sharing data that uses human-readable text to store and transmit data. JSON files are stored with the .json extension. JSON requires less formatting and is a good alternative for XML. JSON is derived from JavaScript but is a language-independent data format. The generation and parsing of JSON is supported by many modern programming languages. application/json is the media type used for JSON.
