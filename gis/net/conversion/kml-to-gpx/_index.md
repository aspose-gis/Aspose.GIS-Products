 Conversion can be done with just one line of code while using
 *VectorLayer.Convert* 
 method. It takes 4 parameters as detailed below.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  A string type file path to the source KML file
1.  Source driver to let the API know about the input format. Set it to Drivers.Kml
1.  The string type file path to the destination GPX data file
1.  Destination driver to specify output format. Set it to Drivers.Gpx

KML (Keyhole Markup Language) contains geospatial information in XML notation. KML can be opened in Geographic Information System (GIS) applications provided they support it. Many applications have started providing support for KML format after it has been adopted as international standard.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="GPX" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/gis/gpx/" >}}

GPX extension represents GPS Exchange format for interchange of GPS data between applications and web services on the internet. It is a light-weight XML format that contains GPS data i.e. waypoints, routes and tracks to be imported and red by multiple programs. GPX is open and is supported by variety of applications and GPS devices.
