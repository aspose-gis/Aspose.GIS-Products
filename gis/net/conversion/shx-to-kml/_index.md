 method. It takes 4 parameters as detailed below.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  A string type file path to the source SHX file
1.  Source driver to let the API know about the input format. Set it to Drivers.Shapefile
1.  The string type file path to the destination KML data file
1.  Destination driver to specify output format. Set it to Drivers.Kml

KML, Keyhole Markup Language) contains geospatial information in XML notation. Files saved as KML can be opened in Geographic Information System (GIS) applications provided they support it. Many applications have started providing support for KML file format after it has been adopted as international standard. KML uses a tag-based structure with nested elements and attributes. All the tags are case-sensitive and the order of these tags, as per KML Reference, is important to follow.
