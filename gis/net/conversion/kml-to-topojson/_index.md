{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

 Conversion can be done with just one line of code while using
 *VectorLayer.Convert* 
 method. It takes 4 parameters as detailed below.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  A string type file path to the source KML file
1.  Source driver to let the API know about the input format. Set it to Drivers.Kml
1.  The string type file path to the destination TopoJSON data file
1.  Destination driver to specify output format. Set it to Drivers.TopoJson

KML (Keyhole Markup Language) contains geospatial information in XML notation. KML can be opened in Geographic Information System (GIS) applications provided they support it. Many applications have started providing support for KML format after it has been adopted as international standard.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="TopoJSON" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/gis/geojson/" >}}

TopoJSON is a GeoJSON extension that encodes topology. JSON based format designed to represent the geographical features with their non-spatial attributes. This format defines different JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) objects and their joining fashion. JSON format represents a collective information about the Geographical features, their spatial extents, and properties.
