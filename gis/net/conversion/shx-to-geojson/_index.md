 In order to convert SHX to GEOJSON, we’ll use
 [Aspose.GIS for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/gis/net) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use GIS API for C# platform. Open
 [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.gis) 
 package manager, search for
 **Aspose.GIS** 
 and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Steps for converting SHX to GEOJSON in C#" %}}

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

 Conversion can be done with just one line of code while using
 *VectorLayer.Convert* 
 method. It takes 4 parameters as detailed below.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  A string type file path to the source SHX file
1.  Source driver to let the API know about the input format. Set it to Drivers.Shapefile
1.  The string type file path to the destination GEOJSON data file
1.  Destination driver to specify output format. Set it to Drivers.GeoJson

    {{% blocks/products/pf/agp/content h2=".NET GIS Library" %}}

 Aspose.GIS for .NET is a GIS data manipulation and conversion API. It fully supports reading, writing and converting famous GIS data formats such as ESRI Shapefiles, GeoJSON, TopoJSON, ESRI Geodatabase, Geography Markup Language, Google Earth, GPS Exchange Format, MapInfo Formats and OpenStreetMap. It is a standalone .NET based API and does not require any GIS based softwares like ArcGIS / ArcMap, QGIS etc. ‎

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="GEOJSON" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/gis/geojson/" >}}

GeoJSON is a JSON based format designed to represent the geographical features with their non-spatial attributes. This format defines different JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) objects and their joining fashion. JSON format represents a collective information about the Geographical features, their spatial extents, and properties. An object of this file may indicate a geometry (Point, LineString, Polygon), a feature or collection of features. The features reflect addresses and places as point’s streets, main roads and borders as line strings and countries, provinces, and land regions as polygons. Using the GeoJSON, different mobile routing and navigation applications can indicate the coverage of their services. An extension of GeoJSON is TopoJSON that is smaller in size and encodes geospatial topology.
