 In order to convert OSM to SHX, we’ll use
 [Aspose.GIS for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/gis/net) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use GIS API for C# platform. Open
 [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.gis) 
 package manager, search for
 **Aspose.GIS** 
 and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Steps for converting OSM to SHX in C#" %}}

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

 Conversion can be done with just one line of code while using
 *VectorLayer.Convert* 
 method. It takes 4 parameters as detailed below.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  A string type file path to the source OSM file
1.  Source driver to let the API know about the input format. Set it to Drivers.OsmXml
1.  The string type file path to the destination SHX data file
1.  Destination driver to specify output format. Set it to Drivers.Shapefile

    {{% blocks/products/pf/agp/content h2=".NET GIS Library" %}}

 Aspose.GIS for .NET is a GIS data manipulation and conversion API. It fully supports reading, writing and converting famous GIS data formats such as ESRI Shapefiles, GeoJSON, TopoJSON, ESRI Geodatabase, Geography Markup Language, Google Earth, GPS Exchange Format, MapInfo Formats and OpenStreetMap. It is a standalone .NET based API and does not require any GIS based softwares like ArcGIS / ArcMap, QGIS etc.

OpenStreetMap (OSM) is a huge collection of volunteered geographic information stores in different types of files, using different encoding schemes to convert this data into bits and bytes. OSM is a collaborative effort toward the creation of a free editable map of the world.  The primary output of this collaborative effort is geographic data rather than the map itself. The constraints on the use or availability of geographic information across much of the world triggers the need to create an OSM.  The data available from OSM is ready to replace Google Maps for classical applications (Facebook, Craigslist etc.) and default data for GPS receiver’s applications. Although data quality is diverse across the world yet OpenStreetMap data can be conveniently compared with patent data sources.
