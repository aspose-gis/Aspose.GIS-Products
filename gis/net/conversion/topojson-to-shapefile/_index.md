 In order to convert TopoJSON to Shapefile, weâ€™ll use
 [Aspose.GIS for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/gis/net) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use GIS API for C# platform. Open
 [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.gis) 
 package manager, search for
 **Aspose.GIS** 
 and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Steps for converting TopoJSON to Shapefile in C#" %}}

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

 Conversion can be done with just one line of code while using
 *VectorLayer.Convert* 
 method. It takes 4 parameters as detailed below.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  A string type file path to the source TopoJSON file
1.  Source driver to let the API know about the input format. Set it to Drivers.TopoJson
1.  The string type file path to the destination Shapefile data file
1.  Destination driver to specify output format. Set it to Drivers.Shapefile

    {{% blocks/products/pf/agp/content h2=".NET GIS Library" %}}

 Aspose.GIS for .NET is a GIS data manipulation and conversion API. It fully supports reading, writing and converting famous GIS data formats such as ESRI Shapefiles, GeoJSON, TopoJSON, ESRI Geodatabase, Geography Markup Language, Google Earth, GPS Exchange Format, MapInfo Formats and OpenStreetMap. It is a standalone .NET based API and does not require any GIS based softwares like ArcGIS / ArcMap, QGIS etc.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="TopoJSON" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/gis/geojson/" >}}

TopoJSON is a GeoJSON extension that encodes topology. JSON based format designed to represent the geographical features with their non-spatial attributes. This format defines different JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) objects and their joining fashion. JSON format represents a collective information about the Geographical features, their spatial extents, and properties.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="Shapefile" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/gis/shp/" >}}

SHP is the file extension for one of the primary file types used for representation of ESRI Shapefile. It represents Geospatial information in the form of vector data to be used by Geographic Information Systems (GIS) applications. The format has been developed as open specifications in order to facilitate interoperability between ESRI and other software products.
